                <p>Dr. Tanya Harrison calls herself a “professional martian.” 
                  She has spent the last decade working as a scientist and in mission operations on multiple NASA Mars missions, 
                  including the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers. Her specialty lies in geomorphology: the study of a planet’s 
                  evolution based on its surface features. Before Mars however, Tanya had her head in the stars as an astronomer 
                  studying the metal content of star clusters and recurring novae systems. She holds a Ph.D. in Geology from the 
                  University of Western Ontario, a Masters in Earth and Environmental Sciences from Wesleyan University, and a B.Sc. 
                  in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Washington. Currently she is the Director of Research for Arizona 
                  State University’s Space Technology and Science (“NewSpace”) Initiative. Tanya is also an advocate for advancing 
                  the status of women in science and for accessibility in the geosciences. You can find her prolifically tweeting 
                  about the Red Planet—and her experiences with both #WomenInSTEM and #DisabledInSTEM—as @tanyaofmars. 
                  (As a huge foodie however, she’ll likely never choose to make the journey to Mars herself.).</p>

                <p>Andrew Thoesen is a mechanical engineering student at Arizona State University.  After living in Indiana for 23 
                  years and obtaining his undergraduate degree from Purdue University, he worked as an engineer in industry for 
                  several years before returning to graduate school.  Originally exploring hand prosthetics, his focus area shifted 
                  after his lab’s departure in his first year.  He has been exploring space systems and design ever since, first by 
                  leading the design of the AOSAT cubesat followed by examining mobility in granular space environments.  His current 
                  research examines mobility on lunar and asteroid surfaces and he recently completed a summer working at NASA to better 
                  familiarize himself with simulating lunar conditions.
                    Aside from research, Andrew also enjoys engaging the public about space research.  He has spoken at Phoenix Comicon, 
                    nite Phoenix #18 event, and the  Scottsdale Public Library system about his work and the future of space engineering. 
                     Currently he is engaged in an outreach project to bring NASA-designed science experiments and robotic arm building to 
                     a group of 30 8th graders.  When he isn’t working on his research he enjoys the Arizona outdoors by hiking with his 
                     wife, camping, reading, and writing fiction and non-fiction..</p>

Ms. King recognizes that world changing positivity can overcome cycles of poverty, abuse, and other adverse childhood experiences. Ms. King strongly believes that students can achieve limitless potential, and teachers can remain immune to external negative forces when positive thinking and actions are taught as skills and not simply believed to be inherent traits or mindsets. Ms. King’s commitment to education has been recognized by her receiving Arizona State University’s Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College Faculty Award for Community Engagement, Arizona Technology in Education Association’s Pre-Service Faculty of the Year Award, Teach for America’s Paula Jennings Hardison Award, and Glendale Elementary School District’s Challenger Teacher of the Year Award.</p>

            <p>Jason Thompson (Ph.D., Northwestern University) is an Assistant Professor of Music Learning and Teaching in the Herberger 
              Institute for Design and Arts at Arizona State University.  At ASU, he teaches courses and conducts research that 
              explores sociocultural issues in music learning and teaching, socially engaged practice in the arts, and musical 
              engagement in cultural contexts. His most popular course is the Gospel Choir, a credit-bearing ensemble comprised of 
              singers who reflect racial, gender, age, musical, and religious diversities.  The increase in the ensemble’s membership
               by 914% over a two-year period has been serendipitous for the Herberger Institute, which seeks to project music and 
               musical practices typically underrepresented in higher education. Dr. Thompson is a recent recipient of a 10K grant 
               from the National Association for Music Education to explore the community cultural wealth that 13- to 18-year olds 
               in the Phoenix region utilize to do music. Dr. Thompson and his research team of faculty peers and doctoral students
                believe understanding how young people utilize these community resources, as well as where they face limitations, 
                may help the profession develop more effective ways to bridge school and community partnerships and to foster 
                inclusive musical opportunities for underrepresented and underserved young people.</p>
