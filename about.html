                <h5>TED</h5>
                <br>
                TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to ideas worth spreading. Started as a conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives.
                <br>
                <br>
                At a TED conference, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less. TED speakers have included Roger Ebert, Sheryl Sandberg, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Brian Greene, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Three major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Vancouver, Canada, simultaneous with TEDActive, in Whistler, BC; and the TEDGlobal Conference takes place each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                On TED.com, talks from TED conferences are shared with the world for free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday. Through the Open Translation Project, TED Talks are subtitled by volunteers worldwide into more than 90 languages. Through our distribution networks, TED Talks are shared on TV, radio, Netflix and many websites.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                The TEDx initiative grants free licenses to people around the world to organize TED-style events in their communities with TED Talks and live speakers. More than 5,000 TEDx events have been held, and selected talks from these events are also turned into TED Talks videos.

                <br>
                In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxASU, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxASU event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.

                <h5>Arizona State University</h5>
                <br>
                Arizona State University is the New American University, a model developed by ASU's President Michael Crow that re-conceptualizes the current standard of higher education. With this model, ASU seeks to be defined by the students it includes rather than excludes, its impact on the public good and its responsibility for the broader community. In this spirit of innovation, ASU brings together brilliant thinkers from a host of fields to discuss their groundbreaking research and ideas in TEDxASU. This eye-opening, half-day conference offers its attendees the opportunity to listen to individuals who have redefined their respective fields. It is our hope that participants will leave with the desire to become disruptive leaders in their corresponding disciplines.

                <br>
                Since 2016, with support from one of the world’s most renowned and inclusive universities, Arizona State University, we share people’s passions, set spark to the curious mind and encourage our community to flourish upon each other’s ideas. Our events create a playground for the creative mind, through which we connect and engage leading thinkers and doers from the world wide reach of Arizona State University. 
                <br>
                As a student founded organization, one principle tennent we’ve always held is “for the students, by the students”. We recognized a severe disconnect between the student population and recognizing the variety of opportunities available to them as a student. There are so many ways a student can get involved with organizations or people to have a real impact on their surroundings.At ASU, there are students creating the next generation of satellites to be launched to space, students developing new diagnostic methods for diseases such as breast cancer, and students developing new ways to get clean water in developing nations. Through showcasing an array of different ideas being fostered within the university, it is our hope to increase student involvement in areas beyond their classroom.

               <br>
               Fifty years ago, getting cash required a trip to the bank. Humans hadn’t walked on the moon. Interracial romance wasn’t on TV. A gallon of gas cost 34 cents. Heart transplants weren’t an option. Computers were the sizes of rooms.
                <br>
                Fast forward to present day, and our world has completely evolved. We are posed with thrilling opportunities, yet many alarming challenges lie ahead of us. How will our world change when faced with climate change and dwindling resources? What will social interaction look like? Will we discover cures for more fatal diseases? What will social media encompass in the future?
                <br>
                At TEDxASU 2019, we want to explore what life will look like in the 22nd century and how we can take part in building it together. This is NextGen TEDxASU.
