                  Fifty years ago, getting cash required a trip to the bank. Humans hadn’t walked on the moon. Interracial romance wasn’t on TV. A gallon of gas cost 34 cents. Heart transplants weren’t an option. Computers were the sizes of rooms.

                  <br>
                  Fast forward to present day, and our world has completely evolved. We are posed with thrilling opportunities, yet many alarming challenges lie ahead of us. How will our world change when faced with climate change and dwindling resources? What will social interaction look like? Will we discover cures for more fatal diseases? What will social media encompass in the future?
                  <br>
                  <br>                  
                  At TEDxASU 2019, we want to explore what life will look like in the 22nd century and how we can take part in building it together. This is NextGen TEDxASU.
